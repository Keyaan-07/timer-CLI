# timer-CLI

I created this timer to add something more to the GUI timer i made and this time i wanted to make it in CLI because i suck at making GUI...

this time the timer tells when you alarm is gonna run off
in future i am also thinking about adding notifications that pop up when the timer ends

here is a link to the demo video
